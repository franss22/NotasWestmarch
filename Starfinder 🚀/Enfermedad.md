La party está infectada con Viral Vapor

Por ahora, están todos en Latent

### Viral Vapor

**Type** disease (contact, inhaled, or injury); **Save** Fortitude DC 18  
**Track** physical; **Frequency** 1/day  
**Effect** At the debilitated state, the victim becomes partially vaporous. Attacks made by or targeting the victim have a 25% miss chance. At bedridden, this effect ends and the victim is incorporeal. At dead, the victim’s form completely dissipates into fine particles.  
**Cure** 2 consecutive saves

**Healthy—Latent—Weakened—Impaired—Debilitated—Bedridden—Comatose—Dead**

### Latent

The victim has contracted a disease. She suffers no ill effects yet, but if the disease is contagious, she can pass it on.

### Weakened

The victim is sickened and fatigued.

### Impaired

The victim is exhausted. Whenever she takes a standard or full action, she must succeed at a Fortitude save at the disease’s DC or lose the action and become nauseated for 1 minute.

### Debilitated

Strenuous actions cause the victim pain. If she takes a standard action, she immediately loses 1 Hit Point.

### Bedridden

The victim is awake and can converse, but she can’t stand on her own or take any other actions or reactions.

### Comatose

The victim is unconscious and feverish, and can’t be woken.

### Dead

The victim is dead, and her corpse may still be contagious.

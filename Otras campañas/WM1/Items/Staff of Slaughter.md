# Bells of Hate 
## Very Rare, requires Attunement
Staff +2 
While attuned and holding this staff, you can cast Disguise Self at will (DC 17). You can also cast Enemies Abound at will (DC 17). When you target a crature with this spell, you cannot do so again until the next day. 
You can toll the bells at the end of the staff to substitute the vocal component of a spell (it does not count as subtle). 
Curse: While attuned to this item, whenever you roll initiative, you must make an INT save DC 17 or suffer the effects of enemies abound for 1 minute.
